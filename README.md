### PRODUCTION

## Project Description

This is a full-stack application developed with React, Vite, and Sass.  
The app stores its data inside a JSON file within the project, ensuring data persistence even after refreshing the page.

### Features:

- On the left side of the screen, there are two input fields where users can enter information for each option.
- In the center, there is a multi-select dropdown component implemented for selecting multiple options.
- On the right side, a list of items is displayed with the ability to remove items from the list.
- Added and removed options are saved and retained thanks to the JSON-based data storage.

Data persistence is maintained through storing and reading the information from the JSON file within the project.
